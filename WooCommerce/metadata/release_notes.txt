We’ve been working hard on a new feature to help you manage your coupons. It’s a work in progress, but you can get an early look by turning the beta feature on in Settings under the More tab. We welcome your early feedback!

We also fixed a few bugs with variable products with prices accidentally cleared when changing inventory levels.
